    For this homework we fallowed the given information.So we will split this
in 2 sections :

    - How to establish the topology
        So in order for each of the processes that are given to know the
      topology we should do several things:
                                            ~ each of the coordinators have to
      read from their file to find out which of the processes will be their
      subordinate worker. In this case we will nee some sort of data to store
      the values given so we will create a matrix that has 3 rows (one for each
      coordinator) and a variable number of columns based on the number of
      subordinates given in the file. After doing this each of the 3 will have
      stored who are the subordinate processes.
                                            ~ each of the 3 will send to their
      subordinates their rank in order for the workers to know who is the
      "master" to which they will send data.
                                            ~ next step is that each of the 3
      will have to send to the other coordinators the rank of the processes
      that they are in charge. We will achieve this by using MPI_Send and
      MPI_Recv.
                                            ~ after the previous step each of
      the coordinators will know the entire topology so they are able to let
      each of their subordinates know the topology, as previous the
      coordinators will use MPI_Send to send the data and the workers will
      receive it using MPI_Recv.

        Each of the process will display the topology immediately after finding
      it

    - How to perform calculations
        In this case the topology from the previous point must be respected.
      In addition we know the fact that we have to take an array and multiply
      each element with 2 but the array is known only by the process 0 and
      the multiplication must be done just by workers so for this we will do
      the following :
                        ~ We have to think that the 0 can send directly
      information to its subordinate
                        ~ In order to provide the information from the
      array the information must be send to process 1 and 2 and from there
      they will forward the information to their workers
                        ~ Each of the subordinates must report to their
      coordinator so after receiving the chunk from the array they will
      double it and send the chunk back to their coordinator.
                        ~ In the end process 0 must receive from process
      1, 2 and its subordinates the data and put it back in the original array.
                        ~ After all this process 0 will display the doubled
      array.
                        ~ To spread the data we used the same method that we
      used to previous homework and labs start and end, the difference
      between them will be how large the chunk will be. And when it is time
      to put back the array we will use the start to know from where in the
      array we should place the updated elements.

    Something special to be mention is that at each MPI_Send we will display
the sender and the receiver rank in order to see the exchange of data will be
done correctly.
